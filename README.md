# YOLO-V5-Distance-Estimation
This repository contains a complete code for custom objection detection and distance estimation using YOLO-V5. This distance estimation code is works based on focal length of the detecting camera. while working with my code make sure that you should install the required python libraries.

## Hello friends :wave:
This is my distance estimation code.<br />
**step 1:** open command prompt, give directry location to where the files kept and type "pip install requirements.txt". then it will download all required libraries to our system.<br />
__step 2:__ open distance_estimation.py file and give your focal lenghth of our detection camera and give correct directory location path.<br />
 
 ### if you are don't know your camera focal length don't worry :v:<br />
 this code also helps you to find the focal length of your camera. please follow the steps below,<br />
 * uncommand d=15, f = (w*d)/W and print the focal length(f) using print function.<br />
 * keep the object 15 cm apart from the camera. the generating average focal lenth is your camera focal length.
